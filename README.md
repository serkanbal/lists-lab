# Lists - Schools

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be completed in pairs._

In this lab, you will be creating a simple LinkedList. After the basics of the List are finished, you will create a "School" filled with students.

Use your LinkedList and `java.util.ArrayList` to complete the tasks in the commented sample code.

## Exercise

#### Requirements


- Complete the `MyLinkedList.java` file (excluding the Iterator)
- Complete the `Driver.java` file
- Correctly determine when to use a LinkedList or an ArrayList

**Bonus:**

- Complete the Iterator
- Complete the second add method


#### Starter code

In the `starter-code` folder, you will find a Node class and the beginnings of a LinkedList. You will also find a Driver class that contains instructions for how to interact with the Students in the school.


#### Deliverable

A simple Java program that completes the instructions in `Driver.java`
